# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SimuNet is a multi-agent social network simulator designed to study engagement dynamics, content moderation effectiveness, and systemic effects of platform policies. The system simulates realistic social media interactions between user agents, content agents, moderator agents, and platform algorithms to provide insights into how different policies affect engagement patterns, misinformation spread, and community behavior. This platform will serve as a research tool for understanding the complex trade-offs between user engagement and content safety that social media platforms like Meta face daily.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Architecture

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a multi-agent system with distinct agent types, so that I can simulate realistic social network interactions and study emergent behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create User Agents that can post, like, comment, share, and flag content
2. WHEN content is created THEN the system SHALL instantiate Content Agents with metadata including topic, sentiment, misinformation score, and virality potential
3. WHEN content is published THEN Moderator Agents SHALL automatically analyze it for harmful content using NLP classifiers
4. WHEN the simulation runs THEN a Platform Agent SHALL manage feed ranking, content recommendation, and engagement optimization
5. IF an agent type is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue operating with remaining agent types without errors

### Requirement 2: Content Generation and Management

**User Story:** As a simulation operator, I want realistic content generation with rich metadata, so that I can study how different content types spread through the network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User Agent creates content THEN the system SHALL generate posts with synthetic text and semantic embeddings
2. WHEN content is created THEN it SHALL be assigned attributes for topic classification, sentiment analysis, and virality scoring
3. WHEN content contains potential misinformation THEN it SHALL be tagged with a misinformation probability score
4. WHEN content is flagged by moderators THEN the system SHALL update its status and track moderation actions
5. IF content violates platform policies THEN it SHALL be removed from user feeds while maintaining audit trails

### Requirement 3: Engagement Simulation

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to model realistic user engagement patterns, so that I can study how content spreads and what drives virality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with content THEN the system SHALL track likes, shares, comments, and view duration
2. WHEN content receives high engagement THEN it SHALL increase in virality score and feed ranking priority
3. WHEN users share content THEN it SHALL propagate to their network connections with engagement decay factors
4. WHEN the platform algorithm processes feeds THEN it SHALL rank content based on configurable engagement vs safety weights
5. IF engagement patterns indicate coordinated behavior THEN the system SHALL flag potential bot activity

### Requirement 4: Content Moderation System

**User Story:** As a platform safety researcher, I want automated content moderation with configurable policies, so that I can study the effectiveness of different moderation approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is published THEN Moderator Agents SHALL analyze it using pre-trained NLP models for toxicity, hate speech, and misinformation
2. WHEN harmful content is detected THEN the system SHALL flag, shadow-ban, or remove it based on policy configuration
3. WHEN moderation actions occur THEN the system SHALL log decisions with confidence scores and reasoning
4. WHEN comparing moderation policies THEN the system SHALL support strict, moderate, and lenient enforcement modes
5. IF false positives occur THEN the system SHALL track precision and recall metrics for moderation effectiveness

### Requirement 5: Policy Experimentation Framework

**User Story:** As a policy researcher, I want to experiment with different platform policies, so that I can measure their impact on engagement and safety outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running experiments THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing of different feed ranking algorithms
2. WHEN policy changes are applied THEN the system SHALL measure impact on engagement rates, misinformation spread, and user satisfaction
3. WHEN comparing policies THEN the system SHALL generate comparative reports on key metrics
4. WHEN experiments complete THEN the system SHALL export results in formats suitable for statistical analysis
5. IF policy conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize safety over engagement by default

### Requirement 6: Real-time Monitoring and Visualization

**User Story:** As a simulation operator, I want real-time visualization of network dynamics, so that I can observe emergent behaviors and system performance during experiments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL display a real-time social graph showing user connections and interactions
2. WHEN content spreads THEN the visualization SHALL show propagation paths with color-coding for content types
3. WHEN moderation actions occur THEN they SHALL be highlighted in the visualization with action timestamps
4. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the dashboard SHALL display engagement rates, moderation statistics, and network clustering coefficients
5. IF system performance degrades THEN monitoring alerts SHALL notify operators of bottlenecks or failures

### Requirement 7: Data Storage and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want persistent storage of simulation data, so that I can perform post-hoc analysis and reproduce experimental results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents interact THEN the system SHALL store all interactions in MongoDB with timestamps and metadata
2. WHEN content is created THEN its embeddings SHALL be stored in a vector database for similarity searches
3. WHEN simulations complete THEN all data SHALL be exportable in standard formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
4. WHEN querying historical data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by time ranges, agent types, and content categories
5. IF data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain backup copies and integrity checks

### Requirement 8: Scalability and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to handle large-scale simulations, so that I can study network effects with thousands of agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL support at least 10,000 concurrent user agents
2. WHEN processing high volumes THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for user interactions
3. WHEN running distributed simulations THEN the system SHALL use containerization and orchestration for horizontal scaling
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL expose metrics via Prometheus for Grafana dashboards
5. IF resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance rather than failing

### Requirement 9: Research Integration

**User Story:** As an academic researcher, I want integration with research tools and reproducible experiments, so that I can publish findings and share methodologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting experiments THEN the system SHALL support Jupyter notebook integration for analysis workflows
2. WHEN generating results THEN the system SHALL create reproducible experiment configurations and random seeds
3. WHEN sharing research THEN the system SHALL export citation-ready datasets and methodology documentation
4. WHEN validating findings THEN the system SHALL support statistical significance testing and confidence intervals
5. IF research standards change THEN the system SHALL adapt to new reproducibility and ethics requirements
